# -SmartBug-AI-Powered-Bug-Classifier-Automated-Issue-Verifier
SmartBug is an AI-driven system that classifies software bug reports using Natural Language Processing and automates verification of issues through testing frameworks. Designed for QA engineers and developers, it streamlines the bug triaging process and enhances software reliability through intelligent classification and automation.

🚀 Features - 
🔍 Bug Classification: Automatically classifies bug reports into categories like UI Bug, Performance Issue, Crash, Functional Bug, etc.

📊 Severity Prediction: Predicts the impact of bugs (Low, Medium, High, Critical) using ML models.

🤖 Test Automation Trigger: Runs test scripts (via Pytest or Selenium) based on bug type and predicted severity.

🧠 NLP-Powered Engine: Uses TF-IDF and Logistic Regression for efficient classification from textual data.

🧪 Built-in Test Suite: Includes unit tests and test coverage reports to ensure system reliability.

🌐 (Optional) Web interface for bug submission and real-time predictions.

🧰 Tech Stack - 
Python (Core)

scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy (ML + Data)

NLTK / spaCy (Text Preprocessing)

Pytest / Selenium (Automation)

Flask or Streamlit (Optional UI)
